Named Import 
 - its not an object Destructuring 
 - We use like import { xyz } from "./path"

Default Import

Object Destructure

config.js file

One way data binding

eact use 1 way binding

Every component in react maintain a state

Why we need state variable - 
 - React wont know if we update local variable and ui will not been changed
